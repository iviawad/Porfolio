    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I am Malek, and I grew up in Jordan. and in life, both good and bad experiences tend to shape the way we build the passion needed to pursue a desired career path.<br />
        Unfortunately, cancer is a topic that is close to the hearts of us all. During my second year at University as a Computer Science major, <br />
        my Mother was diagnosed with a terminal form of cancer. She struggled with it for two years until she passed away a few months after my graduation. <br />
        This experience had a huge impact on me, and was the driving factor in my decision to work in the radiation therapy industry at ViewRay as a Software QA Engineer</p>

    <p> As part of the R&D team, I am constantly exposed to the forefront of innovation in the entire field of radiation therapy.<br />
        Currently, industry leaders are competing to integrate Artificial Intelligence into their clinical treatment workflows. <br />
        This development has the potential to reduce treatment time by four-fold, hence increasing patient throughput by four times while maximizing accuracy and reducing radiation toxicity. </p>

    <p> My first practical experience with AI came from my internship with Rababa, one of the top game development companies across the Middle East.<br />
        I was responsible for utilizing the Unity Engine in collaboration with C# to create an algorithm for the motion of non-player characters (NPCs).<br />
        Immediately, I was fascinated by the ability to recreate the human thought process into a practical, digital form. This positive experience carved my passion to learn and explore diffrent codding languages</p>

    <p> I have been utilizing my Software and Technical skills to help the quest to re-envision radiation therapy to conquer cancer. <br />
        I support my teammates fully by conducting thorough and detailed work, including designing test plans, scenarios, <br />
        scripts, automating solutions or procedures, and taking the initiative to solve technical problems</p>
